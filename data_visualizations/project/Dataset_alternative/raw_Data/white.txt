Footnotes:
"1. Data for in situ Breast Cancers are listed separately from Breast Cancers and not included in the ""all sites"" category."
"---"
Caveats:
"1. The ""Show Totals"" checkbox is disabled when data are grouped by Cancer Sites or by Childhood Cancer, because aggregate"
"values are displayed in the table. Also be aware that charts and maps containing both aggregate and detail data could be"
"misleading."
"2. Age-adjusted rates are not available when results are grouped by age."
"3. Data are suppressed if fewer than 16 cases are reported in the specific category. Data for the ""Asian / Pacific Islander"","
"""American Indian or Alaska Native"", and the ""Other Races Combined"" race categories are suppressed at the Metropolitan"
"Statistical Area level for populations less than 50,000 persons. Data are suppressed at the state level for certain race and"
"ethnicity groups: 1) American Indian or Alaska Native data are suppressed at the state level for Delaware, Georgia, Illinois,"
"Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, and South Carolina; 2) Asian or Pacific Islander data are suppressed at the"
"state level for Delaware, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, and South Carolina; 3) Hispanic data are supressed at the state"
"level for Delaware, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Missouri, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cancer-v2011.html#Confidentiality."
"4. Gender-specific cancers will show 'Not Applicable' when the wrong sex is selected. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cancer-v2011.html#Genital Cancers List."
"5. Data are from selected statewide and metropolitan area cancer registries that meet data quality criteria."
"6. For the 2005 year, the Census Bureau estimates that 203,937 persons were displaced from Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and"
"Texas due to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. CDC WONDER does not include the displaced persons in the 2005 population counts for"
"these states, nor are these counts included in the summary populations for the affected division, regions or national"
"population. However, the USCS web site does include these displaced persons in the national population figures for 2005."
"7. Information on primary site, behavior, and histology was coded according to the International Classification of Diseases for"
"Oncology, Third Edition (ICD-O-3) and categorized according to the revised SEER recodes dated January 27, 2003, which define"
"standard groupings of primary cancer sites."
